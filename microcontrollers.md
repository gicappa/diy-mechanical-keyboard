## Microcontroller Selection

### Key Considerations

- **Bluetooth or Wired Keyboard?**
    - For wireless keyboards, consider **NiceNano microcontrollers** or **NiceNano-compatible boards**. These use affordable components, often based on **Raspberry Pi** technology.
- **Number of Keys?**
    - For fewer keys, consider **ProMicro** or **FROOD** microcontrollers. These are part of the **Arduino** family and are designed for **HID devices**, like custom keyboards.

### Additional Components

Depending on the number of keys, you may need to use **diodes** to manage key matrices and prevent ghosting.

## Soldering Tools

- **Basic Soldering Iron**: Costs around 20 euros. These typically have a fixed temperature, usually between 300°C and 400°C.
- **Advanced Soldering Iron**: Offers temperature regulation for more precise control.
- **Soldering Station**: Provides a more stable and consistent temperature, ideal for complex soldering tasks.
- **Digitally Controlled Soldering Iron**: Highly accurate temperature control, typically priced at around 30 euros.

On **AliExpress**, the **Yihua** brand (from China) is recommended for quality soldering tools.

## Soldering Wire

- The best soldering wire is a **63% tin and 37% lead** mixture, but it is illegal in Europe due to the toxicity of lead.
- Set your soldering station to **1.5 times the melting temperature** of the solder for optimal performance.
- **Avoid soldering above 300°C**, as it can damage electronic components.
- The **soldering order** is important to prevent overheating and damaging components.

Some soldering wires include **flux** inside. While many don't use additional flux, it's highly recommended for small components as it helps the solder adhere to pins and spread across the PCB. Flux can be applied using a syringe, brush, or needle.

## Wire Diameter

- **For small components**: Use a wire diameter of **0.5mm**.
- **For larger components (e.g., switch sockets)**: Use **1.0mm** wire.
- **General Use**: 0.8mm is a versatile option, but you can generally choose between **0.5mm** and **1.0mm** depending on your components.

## Tools for Fixing Mistakes

- **Solder Sucker**: A mechanical pump that removes excess solder.
- **Desoldering Braid**: Useful for removing small amounts of solder and correcting minor mistakes.

## Additional Tools

- **Tweezers**: Essential for handling small components.
- **Magnifying Glasses**: Help with fine details during soldering.
- **Good Lighting**: A bright lamp is crucial for proper illumination while soldering.
- **Silicone Mat**: Useful for placing the PCB on your workbench securely.

## Practice Tips

If you're new to soldering or working on an expensive project, consider **practicing by dismantling and reassembling** old components.

## Surface-Mount Components

Soldering **surface-mount components** can range from easy to tricky, depending on the part. For example, **diodes** are easier and require only small amounts of solder.

## Soldering Tips and Maintenance

- **Tip Selection**: There are different shapes and sizes of soldering iron tips. Choose the correct one for your task.
- **Oxidation**: Oxidation forms on the tip during soldering, so it's important to **clean the tip before use**, not after.
- **Cleaning Tips**: Use a **tip refresher** (available in powder or paste). Heat the soldering iron, dip it into the refresher for a few seconds, and clean the tip with a damp sponge. Clean the tip while it’s still hot.

## Microcontroller Selection

### Key Considerations

- **Bluetooth or Wired Keyboard?**
    - For wireless keyboards, consider **NiceNano microcontrollers** or **NiceNano-compatible boards**. These use affordable components, often based on **Raspberry Pi** technology.
- **Number of Keys?**
    - For fewer keys, consider **ProMicro** or **FROOD** microcontrollers. These are part of the **Arduino** family and are designed for **HID devices**, like custom keyboards.

### Additional Components

Depending on the number of keys, you may need to use **diodes** to manage key matrices and prevent ghosting.
